# Hex Code Visualizer

Hex Code Visualizer is a simple, intuitive tool designed to help developers and creatives easily compare, customize, and organize color palettes. Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**, it offers a live preview to visualize how selected colors would look on a page.

## Features
- **Add Colors to Palette**: Users can add up to **6 colors** to their palette.
- **Drag and Reorder**: Rearrange colors by dragging and dropping.
- **Copy Hex Codes**: Easily copy hex codes directly from the palette.
- **Live Preview**: Visualize how colors would look when applied to common web components, including:
  - Navbar
  - Header
  - Subheading
  - Body Text
  - Buttons
  - Input Fields
- **Dynamic Fallbacks**: Automatically assign fallback colors if the palette has fewer than 6 colors.
- **Compare Color Palettes**: Users can compare 2 color palettes at a time.

## Technologies Used
